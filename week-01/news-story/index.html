          Prosecutors have dropped some of the charges against an Australian
          woman accused of killing three relatives and seriously injuring
          another with a toxic mushroom lunch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Erin Patterson will not face trial over allegations she also attempted
          to murder her husband, after those charges were withdrawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          She still faces four charges: three counts of murder and one of
          attempted murder.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 50-year-old has always maintained her innocence and has pleaded
          not guilty, with her trial to begin in the Supreme Court of Victoria
          on Wednesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three people died in hospital days after the July 2023 lunch,
          including Patterson's former in-laws, Don Patterson, 70, and Gail
          Patterson, 70, as well as Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson, 66.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heather's husband, 68-year-old Baptist pastor Ian Wilkinson, survived
          after weeks of treatment in hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
          The jury has been picked and is receiving instructions from the judge
          ahead of opening statements, which are expected Wednesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Justice Christopher Beale told the jury that most if not all them
          would probably have been aware of the previous charges in relation to
          Patterson's husband, but said that the Director of Public Prosecutions
          had dropped them.
        </p>
        <p>"In other words... you must put them out of your mind," he said.</p>
        <p>
          He also urged them to "dispassionately" weigh the evidence in the
          case, using their heads and not their hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trial is being held at a small courthouse in Morwell, about 60km
          (37 miles) from Leongatha, Victoria, where prosecutors allege the
          lunch took place.
